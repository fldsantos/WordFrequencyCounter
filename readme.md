# Word Frequecy Counter

## Small project to help me understand C++ syntax better, with classes, functions, Lambda functions, sorting methods, and algorithms.

### This program analyzes a text file and shows the frequency of its words. It outputs its values to another text file, showing the words with the higher frequency, descending to the ones with least frequency.

I used a similar tool in [this website](http://www.writewords.org.uk/word_count.asp#google_vignette) to help me to identify recurrent words in pieces of text like articles, and religious scriptures. I wanted to see if I can reproduce the same algorithm in C++.

This project was done in around 12 hours. Here is a video showing its functionalities and design.

# Development Environment

This project was written in Visual Studio Code. I had to download the C++ extension, and set the editor's PATH to find the Clang compiler that was pre-installed in my macbook. By doing that, I could set up the environment for me to code.

The programming language I used was C++, and I used some of its built-in libraries like stringstream, iostream, algorithm, and others.

# Future Work

Some ideas I intend to add in the future

- Separating classes from the main class
- Designing GUI to paste different text in real time
- I would like to make an API
